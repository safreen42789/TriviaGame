# TriviaGame
Welcome to The Office Trivia Game!  
You are allotted 15 seconds to answer six multiple choice questions about all things The Office.  Once you hit the start button the timer will go off, your score will be given either at the end of 15 seconds or if you get done early and hit the stop botton. At the end of the game you will be given your score of correct and incorrect answers.
Let the office games begin!
